# Roles
You can choose from a wide range of roles. I've tried to group them.

Just uncomment a role inside `base.yml` to enable it.

## [Basics](roles_basics.md)
A set of basic stuff, everyone should need.

## [Development](roles_development.md)
Tools for software development.

## [Mobile Development](roles_mobile_development.md)
Tools for developing mobile applications.

## [Applications](roles_applications.md)
Primary binary applications installed via `brew cask`.
